RECEIVED POWER PREDICTION IN MOBILE  NETWORKS BASED ON NEURAL  NETWORKS 

Modelling and accurately predicting the received power has received significant 
attention in wireless communications researches, as predicting the received power has 
its importance to wireless network planning and optimization. The received power 
value is also an indicator of the quality of the station coverage. Thatâ€™s why an 
appropriate channel modelling approach is highly demanded. 
The existing channel modelling approaches mainly include deterministic models and 
stochastic models. The deterministic models usually require detailed three-dimensional 
(3D) environment model including geometry and material information. The stochastic 
models are based on mathematical expressions which are difficult in describing 
complex environments. For mountainous and suburban scenarios, where the 
environment is complex and difficult to reconstructed, both channel modelling 
approaches are limited
